Creating a Windows VM
+++++++++++++++++++++

Deploy a Windows VM from Prism Central.

.. note::

  Nutanix provides a set of guest tools and drivers comparable to VMware Tools. To install a Windows-based OS, the I/O drivers must be provided at install time. Nutanix provides a customized set of virtualized I/O drivers for Windows OS on AHV.

In **Prism Central > Explore > VMs**, click **Create VM**.

      - **Type** - DISK
      - **Operation** - Allocate on Storage Container
      - **Storage Container** - Default Container
      - **Size (GiB)** - 30 GiB
      - Select **Add**

Add a vNIC
................

- Select **Add New NIC**
- **VLAN Name** - Primary
- Select **Add**

Click **Save** to create the VM.


Now let's power on the VM:

Select the VM, then click the **Actions** button at the top of the screen and select **Power on**.


Next let's open a console session:

Select the VM, then click **Launch Console** from the **Actions** drop-down menu.

Progress through the standard install questions until you reach the Windows install location.

.. note::
  Choose **Datacenter with GUI** and **Custom** installation when presented with the choice.

Click **Load Driver** and navigate to the CD where the Nutanix VirtIO is mounted.

Browse the CD, and select the directory that corresponds to the Windows OS being installed.

Click Next.

After the drivers are loaded, the disk created in step 1 appears as an installation target. Select that disk and continue with the normal install process.

After the installation completes, the Windows install ISO can be unmounted and the additional CD-ROM used for the drivers can be removed from the VM.

.. note::

  In ESXi:

  - After a VM is created via VMware vSphere, it appears in the Prism VMs list.
  - Alternatively, if a VM is created via Prism, it appears in the VMware vSphere UI. An example is shown in the image below.
